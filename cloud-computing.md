# Cloud computing

(from https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-145/final)
is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.

## five characteristics

1. On-demand self-service
2. Broad network access
3. Resource pooling
4. Rapid elasticity
5. Measured service




## four deployment models:

- Private cloud: specific to organizations
- Public cloud: available for general public
- Community cloud: specific communities
- Hybrid cloud: in the middle of two or more other models
