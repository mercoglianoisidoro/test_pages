# Microservices


([from wikipedia ] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices))
A microservice is a self-contained piece of business functionality with clear interfaces.
From a strategy perspective, microservices architecture essentially follows the Unix philosophy of "Do one thing and do it well".

## Some advantages

- reliability
- agility
- simplicity
- better scaling (each service can scale with the approach that suit it the best)


The introduction of formal API provide a reliable contract among microservices.

## Some disadvantages

- debugging more complicated
- communication between services is more complicate
- design and architecture can be more complicate
