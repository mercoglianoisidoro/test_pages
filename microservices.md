# Microservices


([from wikipedia ] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices))
A microservice is a self-contained piece of business functionality with clear interfaces.
From a strategy perspective, microservices architecture essentially follows the Unix philosophy of "Do one thing and do it well".
