# Single-node design pattern

Single-node patters describe solutions using collection of container hosted by the same machine or by a container group, like a kubernetes Pod.

The containers :
- are coupled on some degree
- share local resources
- can communicate directly
- often are the pieces of more complexe distribute systems
